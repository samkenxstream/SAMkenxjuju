# This function tests charm deployment with a single filesystem storage unit and a single persistent block device
# storage unit.
#  Steps taken to the test:
#       - Deploy dummy-storage charm with a single block storage unit (ebs)
#         and a single filesystem storage unit (rootfs).
#       - Check charm status once the deployment is done.
#           > Application status should be active.
#       - Check charm storage units once the deployment is done.
#           > Total number of storage units should be 2.
#           > Name of storage units should be in align with charm config.
#           > Properties of storage units should be as defined.
#               - Storage Type, Persistent Setting and Pool.
