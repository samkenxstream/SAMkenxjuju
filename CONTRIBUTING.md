Building Juju
=============

## Installing Go

`juju` is written in [Go](https://go.dev/), a modern, compiled, statically typed,
concurrent language.

Generally, Juju is built against the most recent version of Go, with the caveat that Go versions are not incremented during a release cycle. This means that `develop` will typically be using the latest version of Go, but any given release branch may lag by one version or so.  Check the `go.mod` file at the root of the project for the targeted version of Go, as this is authoritative.

For example, the following indicates that Go 1.20 is targeted:

```
module github.com/juju/juju

go 1.20
```

### Official distribution

Go can be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) from the official distribution.

### via snap

[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/go) may also be used to install Go on Linux.

    snap install go --channel=1.19/stable --classic

## Build Juju and its dependencies

The easiest way to get the Juju source code is to clone the GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/juju/juju.git

To build/install from source, `cd` into the root directory of the cloned repo,
and use `make`.
- `make go-build` will build the Juju binaries and put them in a
  `_build` subdirectory.
- `make go-install` will build the Juju binaries and install them in your
  [$GOBIN directory](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)
  (which defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` or `~/go/bin`).
- `make build` and `make install` are as above, but they will also regenerate
  the facade schema. An up-to-date schema is always checked into the Juju repo,
  so you shouldn't need to do this unless you make facade changes.

Getting started
===============

Git
---

Juju uses `git` for version control. To get started, install it and configure
your username:

```bash
git config --global user.name "A. Hacker"
git config --global user.email "a.hacker@example.com"
```

For information on setting up and using `git`, check out the following:

* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
* http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
* [GitHub bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/54/articles)

GitHub
------

The upstream Juju repository is hosted on [Github](http://github.com). Patches
to Juju are contributed through pull requests (more on that in the
[Pushing](#pushing) section). So you should have a github account and a fork
there. The following steps will help you get that ready:

1. Sign up for GitHub (a free account is fine): https://github.com/join
2. Add your ssh public key to your account: https://github.com/settings/ssh
3. Hit the "Fork" button on the web page for the Juju repo:
    https://github.com/juju/juju

At this point you will have your own copy under your github account. Note
that your fork is not automatically kept in sync with the official Juju repo
(see [Staying in sync](#staying-in-sync)).

Note that Juju has dependencies hosted elsewhere with other version control
tools.

Local clone
-----------

To contribute to Juju you will also need a local clone of your GitHub fork.
The earlier `go get` command will have already cloned the Juju repo for you.
However, that local copy is still set to pull from and push to the upstream
Juju github account. Here is how to fix that (replace <USERNAME> with your
github account name):

```bash
cd juju
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/juju.git
```

To simplify staying in sync with upstream, give it a "remote" name:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/juju/juju.git
```

Add the check script as a git hook:

```bash
cd juju
ln -s scripts/pre-push.bash .git/hooks/pre-push
```

This will ensure that any changes you commit locally pass a basic sanity
check.  Using pre-push requires git 1.8.2 or later, though alternatively
running the check as a pre-commit hook also works.

Staying in sync
---------------

Make sure your local copy and GitHub fork stay in sync with upstream:

```bash
cd juju
git pull upstream
```

Dependency management
=====================

In the top-level directory of the Juju repo, there is a file,
[go.mod](go.mod), that holds the versions of all the external
Go modules that Juju depends on. That file is used to freeze the code in
external repositories so that Juju is insulated from changes to those repos.

go mod
------

Juju uses Go modules to manage dependencies. Your Go installation will ensure
you are building with the correct version - you don't need to do anything. 

Updating dependencies
---------------------

To update a dependency, use
```
go get -u github.com/the/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Code formatting
===============

Go provides a tool, `go fmt`, which facilitates a standardized format to go source code.  The Juju project has one additional policy:

Imports
-------

Import statements are grouped into 3 sections: standard library, 3rd party
libraries, juju imports. The tool "go fmt" can be used to ensure each
group is alphabetically sorted. eg:

```go
    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"

        "labix.org/v2/mgo"
        "github.com/juju/loggo"
        gc "gopkg.in/check.v1"

        "github.com/juju/juju/state"
        "github.com/juju/worker/v3"
    )
```

Because "gopkg.in/check.v1" will be referenced frequently in test suites, its
name gets a default short name of just "gc".

Workflow
========

As a project, Juju follows a specific workflow:

1. sync with upstream
2. create a local feature branch
3. make desired changes
4. test the changes
5. push the feature branch to your github fork
6. reviews
7. auto-merge
8. continuous-integration

Naturally, it is not so linear in practice. Each of these is elaborated below.

Branches
--------

Generally there are multiple versions of Juju in development concurrently,
and so we keep a separate Git branch for each version. When submitting a
patch, please make sure your changes are targeted to the correct branch.

The currently active branches are:
- `2.9` - bug fixes for Juju 2.9.x
- `3.0` - bug fixes for Juju 3.0.x
- `develop` - bug fixes and new features for Juju 3.1.x

If a bug affects multiple Juju versions, please target the **lowest version**
of Juju which is affected. All patches in earlier versions are eventually
"merged through" to later versions.

Creating a new branch
---------------------

All development should be done on a new branch, based on the correct branch
determined above. Pull the latest version of this branch, then create and
checkout a new branch for your changes - e.g. for a patch targeting `develop`:
```
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b new_feature develop
```

Testing
-------

Some tests may require local lxd to be installed, see
[installing lxd via snap](https://stgraber.org/2016/10/17/lxd-snap-available/).

Juju uses the `gocheck` testing framework, which is automatically installed
as a dependency of `juju`. You can read more about `gocheck` at
http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/check.v1. `gocheck` is integrated into the source of
each package so the standard `go test` command is used to run `gocheck` tests.
For example

```bash
go test github.com/juju/juju/...
```

will run all the tests in the Juju project. By default `gocheck` prints only
minimal output, and as `gocheck` is hooked into the testing framework via a
single `go test` test per package, the usual `go test -v` flags are less
useful. As a replacement the following commands produce more output from
`gocheck`.

```bash
go test -gocheck.v
```

is similar to `go test -v` and outputs the name of each test as it is run as
well as any logging statements. It is important to note that these statements
are buffered until the test completes.

```bash
go test -gocheck.vv
```

extends the previous example by outputting any logging data immediately, rather
than waiting for the test to complete. By default `gocheck` will run all tests
in a package, selected tests can by run by passing `-gocheck.f` to match a
subset of test names.

```bash
go test -gocheck.f '$REGEX'
```

Finally, because by default `go test` runs the tests in the current package,
and is not recursive, the following commands are equal, and will produce no
output.

```bash
cd juju
go test
go test github.com/juju/juju
```

Testing and MongoDB
-------------------

Many tests use a standalone instance of `mongod` as part of their setup. The
`mongod` binary found in `$PATH` is executed by these suites.  If you don't already have MongoDB installed, or have difficulty using your installed version to run Juju tests, you may want to install the [`juju-db` snap](https://snapcraft.io/juju-db), which is guaranteed to work with Juju.

```bash
sudo snap install juju-db --channel 4.4/stable
sudo snap alias juju-db.mongod mongod
sudo snap alias juju-db.mongo mongo
```

Some tests (particularly those under `./store/...`) assume a MongoDB instance
that supports Javascript for map-reduce functions. These functions are not
supported by `juju-mongodb` and the associated tests will fail unless disabled
with an environment variable:

```bash
JUJU_NOTEST_MONGOJS=1 go test github.com/juju/juju/...
```

Pushing
-------

When ready for feedback, push your feature branch to github, optionally after
collapsing multiple commits into discrete changes:

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash develop
git push origin new_feature
```

Go to the web page (https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/juju) and hit the
"Pull Request" button, selecting `develop` as the target.

This creates a numbered pull request on the github site, where members of the
Juju project can see and comment on the changes.

Make sure to add a clear description of why and what has been changed, and
include the Launchpad bug number if one exists.

It is often helpful to mention newly created proposals on the Discourse forum,
especially if you would like a specific developer to be aware of the proposal.

Note that updates to your GitHub project will automatically be reflected in
your pull request.

Be sure to have a look at:

https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests


Contributor licence agreement
----------------------

We welcome external contributions to Juju, but in order to incorporate these
into the codebase, we will need you to sign the
[Canonical contributor licence agreement (CLA)](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors).
This just gives us permission to use your contributions - you still retain full
copyright of your code.

We have a GitHub Action which checks if you have signed the CLA. To ensure this
passes, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure your Git commits are signed by an email that you can access
   (you can't use the `@users.noreply.github.com` email that GitHub provides).
2. Create an account on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/), if you don't
   already have one.
3. Ensure the email you used for Git commits is a **verified** email on your
   Launchpad account. To do this:
   - Go to your Launchpad homepage (`launchpad.net/~[username]`).
   - Check the addresses listed under the **Email** heading. If your Git email
     is listed, you're good.
   - If not, click "Change email settings".
   - Add your Git email as a new address.
   - Follow the instructions to verify your email.
4. Visit the [CLA website](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors), scroll down
   and press "Sign the contributor agreement".
5. Read the agreement and fill in your contact details. Ensure that you provide
   your Launchpad username in the "Launchpad id" box.
6. Press "I agree" to sign the CLA.

Eventually, your Launchpad account should be added to the
["Canonical Contributor Agreement" team](https://launchpad.net/~contributor-agreement-canonical).
You will see it listed under "Memberships" on your Launchpad homepage.
Once this happens, the CLA check will pass, and we will happily review
your contribution.


Sanity checking PRs and unit tests
----------------------

All PRs run pre-merge check - unit tests and a small but representative sample
of functional tests. This check is re-run anytime the PR changes, for example
when a new commit is added.

You can also initiate this check by commenting `/build` in the PR.

Code review
-----------

The Juju project uses peer review of pull requests prior to merging to
facilitate improvements both in code quality and in design.

Once you have created your pull request, it will be reviewed. Make sure to
address the feedback. Your request might go through several rounds of feedback
before the patch is approved or rejected. Once you get an approval from a
member of the Juju project, you are ready to have your patch merged.
Congratulations!

Continuous integration
----------------------

Continuous integration is automated through Jenkins:

The bot runs on all commits during the PRE process, as well as handles merges.
Use the `/merge` comment to land a PR.

Static Analysis
---------------

Static Analysis can be performed by running `make static-analysis`

Required dependencies for full static analysis are:
 - *nix tools (sh, grep etc.)
 - shellcheck
 - python3
 - go
 - golint
 - goimports
 - deadcode
 - misspell
 - unconvert
 - ineffassign
